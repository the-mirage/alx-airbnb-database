# Database Seed Data

This directory (`database-script-0x02`) contains SQL scripts to populate the database with sample data, reflecting real-world usage scenarios. The scripts assume the database schema defined in `schema.sql` has been executed.

## File: `seed.sql`

The `seed.sql` file contains `INSERT` statements to populate the following tables:
- **User**: Users with different roles (guest, host, admin).
- **Property**: Properties hosted by users with role 'host'.
- **Booking**: Bookings made by guests for properties, with varying statuses.
- **Payment**: Payments associated with bookings, using different payment methods.
- **Review**: Reviews submitted by users for properties.
- **Message**: Messages exchanged between users (e.g., guest-host communication).
